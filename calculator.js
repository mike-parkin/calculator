// create vairable to store current entry in
// create an array to push the save the entries in
// create a varible for the total
// create click events for buttons adding the button text into another variable


// if button entry is a number or decimal point it is stored as a string in the entry variable
// if the button 'AC' button is clicked then all varibles are emptied
// if the button 'CE' is clicked then the varible for the current entry becomes ''
// if a mathmatical operator is clicked (x,+,/,-) then the current string is pushed into the array, then the operator is added after
// when the equals is clicked, loop through the array parsing the first element and every second element from there on in to a number varaible
// the loop also checks the operators and perfoms the relative operation for the two numbers on either side of it on the array.
// the answer is then displaed on the screen
